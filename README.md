ShipmentSure: Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Supplier Data
Project Overview
ShipmentSure is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a product shipment will arrive on time based on various supplier and logistics features.
The goal is to assist supply chain managers in identifying potential delays early, improving inventory planning, customer satisfaction, and overall operational efficiency.

This project involves all key phases of a data science workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, tuning, and evaluation, followed by deployment readiness using Flask/FastAPI or Streamlit.

Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection
Dataset obtained from Kaggle:
👉 On-Time Delivery Dataset

It includes shipment, supplier, and product information such as:

Warehouse Block
Mode of Shipment
Customer Care Calls
Customer Rating
Cost of Product
Prior Purchases
Product Importance
Gender
Discount Offered
Weight in Grams
Reached on Time (Target)
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing and EDA
Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical variables.
Checked class imbalance and applied SMOTE to balance the data.
Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering
New derived features were created to enhance model performance:

Cost_to_Weight_ratio = Cost_of_the_Product / Weight_in_gms
Discount_Ratio = Discount_offered / Cost_of_the_Product
CustomerCare_to_PriorPurchase = Customer_care_calls / Prior_purchases
Combined_Impact = Cost_to_Weight_ratio * Discount_Ratio
These features improved the model’s ability to capture shipment cost-efficiency and discount impact.

4️⃣ Model Building and Evaluation
Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
XGBoost
LightGBM
CatBoost
After hyperparameter tuning and regularization:

Best Training Model: XGBoost
Evaluation Metrics Used:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
5️⃣ Model Deployment
Deployment-ready files were created:

shipment_model.pkl → Final trained model
encoder.pkl, scaler.pkl → Preprocessing objects
app.py → Streamlit deployment script
requirements.txt → Dependency file for easy setup
Deployment options:

Flask / FastAPI: For API-based predictions
Streamlit: For a simple interactive web interface
